 Changing public identity, names and gender, is one of the
 complicated tasks of gender transition. How do companies
 and administrations handle this? 
---

Hundreds of services keep our personal informations
in their databases. Those informations are sometimes public to
other people on the Internet.

Changing public identity, names and gender, is one of the
complicated tasks of gender transition. In most countries in the
world, there are many legal obstacles. But another difficulty is
that most services assume their clients names and gender cannot
change.

In our opinion, a company or administration inclusive to trans people
should&nbsp;:

* allow people to update their names and gender with a simple form
and without asking legal proof
* not force people to disclose they are trans to other users,
clients or service's employees
* in particular, never disclose their former name
