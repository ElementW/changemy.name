# How does this work?

For each company, we attribute a number of tags based on experiences
of trans users trying to change their names.

Tags are sorted in categories, depending on how they represent
difficulties or helps for the name changing process. One of these
categories is "Blocking". If a company has a tag in this category,
we do not list other tags, as they would be non significant as long
as there is a blocking problem.

You can read the [complete list of possible tags](https://github.com/jillro/changemy.name/blob/master/data/tags.yml).

If you notice any error on a page, as a user who has experienced name
changing process with a company, or as a company yourself, please
email [info@changemy.name](mailto:info@changemy.name).
