# How does this work?

For each service, we attribute a number of tags based on experiences
of trans users trying to update their names or gender.

Tags are sorted in categories, and depending on the level of
difficulty or help they create for the name changing process. One of these
level is "Blocking". If a service has a "Blocking" tag,
we do not list other tags, as they would be non significant as long
as there is a blocking problem.

You can read the [complete list of possible tags](https://github.com/jillro/changemy.name/blob/master/data/tags.yml).

If you notice any error on a page, as a user who has experienced name
changing process with a service, or as a company or administration yourself,
please email [info@changemy.name](mailto:info@changemy.name).
