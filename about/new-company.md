# How to contribute ❤️

Do you want to contribute? Anyone who experienced a name or gender
change with a company or service can send information, so it appears
on the website. It will help other trans people and put pressure on
non-inclusive companies, so thanks a lot!

The project team processes all information, and your identity
is kept anonymous unless you ask to be credited.

Just email [info@changemy.name](mailto:info@changemy.name) with
the following content:

> **Service or company details**
> * Name of the service or company
> * Country (if this is not local company)
> * Website URL
> * Brief explanation of what does the service (one or two sentences)
>
> **Name changing process**
> 
> * When did you try to change your name?
> * Is there any form where you can change your name, gender, or both?
> * If not, when you contacted support did they misgendered you although
>they had correct information on your gender?
> * Did support first asked you to create a new account? Did they change
>this recommendation after you insisted?
>
> **Legal proof**
> * Whether it is support, or an automated form, do they ask you to send
>an identity proof?
> * If yes, what was the reason given for this? Is an identity proof
>necessary to register to the service in the first place?
> * Does it have to be an official ID?
>
> **Public identity and privacy**
> * Is there a public user id you cannot change without a new account?
> * Are there public comments where you name can appear and which you
>cannot edit or delete? Are they easy to find for other users?
>
> **Your contribution**
> * Do you want to be credited? If yes, please indicate:
>   * Name or pseudonyme
>   * an optional URL (personal website, public Twitter account...)
