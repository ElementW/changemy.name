Spotify allows changing name and gender with [a simple form](https://support.spotify.com/uk/account_payment_help/account_help/edit-your-profile/).

However, [username can't change](https://support.spotify.com/uk/account_payment_help/account_help/change-my-username/).
This username is public, because it appears in the URL on profile sharing.

It seems that this problem does not exist for new accounts,
because usernames are random letters and digits, but this is still a problem
for old accounts.

It is possible to obtain by [contacting support](https://support.spotify.com/fr/contact-spotify-privacy/)
that they migrate playlists and other data to a new account. However, listen history is lost, with all
playlists autogenerated by Spotify.
